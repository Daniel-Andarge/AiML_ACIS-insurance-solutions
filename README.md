## Usage Instructions

### Data Version Control (DVC)

This project uses Data Version Control (DVC) to track and manage datasets.

Data Version Control (DVC) is an open-source tool that helps you manage and version control your datasets. It works alongside Git to provide a complete solution for reproducible and collaborative machine learning projects.

To use the datasets in this project with DVC, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/AiML_ACIS-insurance-solutions.git
   cd AiML_ACIS-insurance-solutions
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize DVC in your project directory:

   ```
   dvc init
   ```

4. Set up a DVC remote storage. For example, to use a remote storage location, run:

   ```
   dvc remote add -d remote_name storage_location
   ```

5. Pull the data from the remote storage:

   ```
   dvc pull
   ```

   This will download the dataset files associated with the project.

6. You can now access the datasets and use them in your project.
